Vertigo is blogging platform similar to [Ghost](https://ghost.org), [Medium](https://medium.com) and [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com). Vertigo is written in Go and has fully featured JSON API and it can be run using single binary on all major operating systems like Windows, Linux and OSX.

The frontend code is powered by Go's `template/html` package, which is similar to Mustache.js. The template files are in plain HTML and JavaScript (vanilla) only appears on few pages. JavaScript is stripped down as much as possible to provide a better user experience on different devices. Vertigo also ships without any CSS frameworks, so it is easy to start customizing the frontend with the tools of your choice.

Thanks to the JSON API, it is easy to add your preferred JavaScript MVC on top of Vertigo. This means that you can create users, submit posts and read data without writing a single line of Go code. For example, one could write a single page application on top of Vertigo just by using JavaScript. Whether you want to take that path or just edit the HTML template files found in `/templates/` is up to you.

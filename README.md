Vertigo is blogging platform similar to [Ghost](https://ghost.org), [Medium](https://medium.com) or [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com). What makes Vertigo different is that it has JSON API for reading and writing data and it is written in Go. Therefore, Vertigo is not only fast, but can be run using single binary on all major operating systems like Windows, Linux and MacOSX without the language development tools.

The frontend code is powered by Go's `template/html` package, which syntax is similar to Mustache.js. The template files are in plain HTML and JavaScript (vanilla) only appears on few pages. JavaScript in general is aimed to be stripped down as much as possible to provide a better user experience on different devices. Vertigo also ships without any CSS frameworks, so it is easy to start customizing the frontend with the framework of your choice.

Thanks to the JSON API, it is easy to add your preferred JavaScript MVC on top of Vertigo. This means that you can create users, submit posts and read data without writing a single line of Go code. So basically, one could write a SPA application on top of Vertigo just by using JavaScript. Whether you want to take that path or just edit the HTML template files found in `/templates/` is up to you.

##Contribute

Contributions are welcome, but before creating a pull request, please run your code trough `go fmt` and [`golint`](https://github.com/golang/lint). If the changes introduce new features, please also add tests for them. Try to also squash your commits into one big one instead many small, to avoid unnecessary CI runs.
